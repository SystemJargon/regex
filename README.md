# regex

I use regex a fair bit. Let's make a repo just for regex. Examples, find and replace or strip text. Could be used in various way, even windows powershell and linux bash. May be applied to graphical apps and text editors too. 

Because some colleagues/admins/friends always ask me for, "can you get/do/remind me" of this in regex. *Saves a search engine crawl for basic answers.
