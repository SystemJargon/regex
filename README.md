# regex

I use regex a fair bit. Let's make a repo just for regex. Examples, find and replace or strip text. Could be used in various way, even windows powershell and linux bash. May be applied to graphical apps and text editors too. 

Further example of usage in [Pi-hole repo - regex folder](https://github.com/SystemJargon/pi-hole/tree/main/regex)
